# [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) solutions

Some of these (all of 2020 and a few in 2019) were done live during the event, the rest were done later.

| Year | Language   | Pt 1 rank (avg / best) | Pt 2 rank (avg / best) |
| ---- | ---------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------- |
| 2019 | TypeScript | 9415 / 749             | 7607 / 569             |
| 2020 | Python     | 1471 / 118             | 1501 / 115             |

In both years, I used [Julia](https://julialang.org/) a few times for brute forcing (which rarely works because the problems are designed to resist it), or sometimes if I was curious how the performance would compare. Julia is a wonderful language for AoC: you can write code without explicit type annotations, which makes it feel like Python, and then add types as needed to help the compiler speed things up.
