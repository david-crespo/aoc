# initially I did this a naive way where I looped through and picked the
# min of the available next ones, etc. etc. I didn't realize that I had
# to use all the adapters, which just meant sorting them and counting the
# gaps. that's why I got my worst ranking yet for part 1 and caught up a lot
# in part 2. luckily this was a clue for how to do part 2 â€” the relevant thing
# is the sequences of gaps

# number of perms for n consecutive 1-gaps
# per explanation below, number of excluded cases is number of ways of
# arranging gaps of bigger than 3, which is 1 + 2 + ... + n-3.
# for n = 4 it's 1, so 8 - 1 = 7
# for n < 4 the number excluded is 0 so it's just 2 ** (n-1)
#
# realized later that this doesn't work for n >= 6 or maybe 7 because
# there's room for two illegal gaps, so there's an additional term needed
# or maybe a whole series
def perms(n):
    return 2 ** (n - 1) - sum(range(1, (n - 3) + 1))


# solution relies on the fact that there are only gaps of size 1 and 3
#
# if the number of consecutive 1-gaps is n = 1, 2, or 3, the possibilities are simple:
# the last one has to be there because it's 3 below the next one. and the one before
# the first 1-gap is only 3 below the last one, i.e., the one after the last 1-gap.
# so the perms are simply 2^(n - 1) because any of them could be there or not
#
# with a sequence of 4 1-gaps (5 consecutive nums) the situation is slightly different
# because there's one case that's not allowed: all 4 being gone. so you subtract 1
# from 2^(n-1) = 2^(4-1) = 2^3 = 8
#
# if there was a sequence of 5 1-gaps, I guess you would have to rule out 3, so it
# would be 2^4 - 3 = 13 you rule out 1-2-3-4-5, 1-2-3-4, and 2-3-4-5 all being left out
